# Twitter-Sentiment-Data-Analysis-
First project based off the tutorial from project-based-learning 
This was my first substantial python project that I've done. 
The project is initially based off the youtube tutorial by Siraj Raval, in which he provides the foundation for a simple Sentiment analysis.
After this, I expanded the project further by adding a matplot graph to make the results more palatable. This idea came from
JavaApocalypse's youtube video. Both are linked below.

This assignment was fantastic at getting my foot in the door in working firsthand with natural language processing software tools.
It was important to understand the concept of Tokenization and how the Tweet, in this case, is broken down into individual words
that can then be rated on the -1 to 1 scale. 
I plan on further working on expanding the project by working on the following:
  - More accurate calculation of polarityTotal
  - Fixing Error where user inputs something other than Y or N and program resumes regardless
  - Add levels of Negativity
